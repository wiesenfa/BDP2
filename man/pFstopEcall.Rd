\title{
operating characteristics of a single-arm trial with a binary endpoint with futility stopping and calling efficacy at interim
}
\description{
Determines the operating characteristics of a single-arm trial with a binary endpoint (success - failure) on the basis of analytical derivations.  The design allows for futility stopping and evaluates efficacy at interim.
Outputs are 
\itemize{
\item         probability of calling efficacy (P.effic)  at each interim analysis 
\item         cumulative probability of calling efficacy up to the interim (P.effic.cum).
\item          probability of futility stopping (P.futil)  at each interim analysis 
\item          cumulative stopping probability up to the interim (P.futil.cum).
