\title{
Operating characteristics of a single-arm trial with a binary
endpoint 
}
\description{
Determines the operating characteristics of a single-arm trial with a binary
endpoint (response, success) and interim efficacy and futility analyses.
Declaration of efficacy and futility (including possibly early stopping)
is based on the posterior probability that the true response rate
is at least pE , pF respectively.

    \code{FALSE}: No evaluation of efficacy. 
    \code{"call"}:  no stop for
    efficacy; in this case the program merely calculates the probability
    that the efficicacy criterion is satisfied (possibly triggering a
    notification of the DMC and the start of the planning of a subsequent
    trial).
    \code{stop}: the study ends if the efficacy criterion is reached at an interim analysis.

\details{

Assumptions:
Endpoint (response/no response) data available for all study patients.
Beta-binomial model. Prior distribution = Beta(shape1, shape2).


\subsection{Decisions based on posterior probabilities}{

The posterior distribution at interim analysis with n.int  patients and k.int
successes is Beta(k.int + shape1F, n.int + shape2F - k.int) and Beta(k.int + shape1E, n.int + shape2E - k.int), respectively.
Efficacy is declared if the posterior probability P(true response rate > pE)
is >= cE.
Futility is declared if the posterior probability P(true success rate > pF)
is < cF.
cF, cE translate into futility/efficacy boundaries (maximum number of
responses leading to early termination for futility/ minimum number of responses
leading to declaring of, or early termination for, efficacy).
}

\subsection{Decisions based on predictive power}{
Given the results of the interim analysis, the predictive power at the final analysis
(n patients, critical number of successes k.crit) is P(X >= k.crit - k.int), where
X  follows a beta-binomial distribution with parameters n'= n - n.int, a = k.int + shape1,
and b = n.int - k.int + shape2.

Efficacy is declared if the predictive power is >= cE (cE must be high, e.g. 0.70).
Futility is declared if the predictive power is < cF (cF must be small, e.g. 0.10).
cE, cF translate into futility/efficacy boundaries (maximum number of
responses leading to early termination for futility/ minimum number of responses
leading to declaring of, or early termination for, efficacy).
