\title{
Operating characteristics of a single-arm trial with a binary endpoint with stopping for futility and stopping for efficacy}
\description{
Determines the operating characteristics of a single-arm trial with a binary endpoint (success - failure) on the basis of analytical derivations.  The design allows for stopping for futility and stopping for efficacy.
Outputs are 
\itemize{
\item          probability of stopping for efficacy (P.effic)  at each interim analysis 
\item          cumulative probability of stopping for efficacy up to the interim (P.effic.cum).
\item          probability of futility stopping (P.futil)  at each interim analysis 
\item         cumulative stopping probability up to the interim (P.futil.cum).
